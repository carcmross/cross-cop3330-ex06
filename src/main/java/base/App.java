/*
 * Your computer knows what the current year is, which means you can incorporate that into your programs. You just have
 * to figure out how your programming language can provide you with that information.
 *
 * Create a program that determines how many years you have left until retirement and the year you can retire. It should
 * prompt for your current age and the age you want to retire and display the output as shown in the example
 * that follows.
 * Example Output
 *
 * What is your current age? 25
 * At what age would you like to retire? 65
 * You have 40 years left until you can retire.
 * It's 2015, so you can retire in 2055.
 *
 * Constraints
 *
 *     Again, be sure to convert the input to numerical data before doing any math.
 *     Donâ€™t hard-code the current year into your program. Get it from the system time via your programming language.
 *
 * Challenge
 *
 *     Handle situations where the program returns a negative number by stating that the user can already retire.
 *
